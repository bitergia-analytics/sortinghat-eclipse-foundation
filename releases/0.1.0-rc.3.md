## sortinghat-eclipse-foundation 0.1.0-rc.3 - (2025-09-09)

**New features:**

 * 5xx errors ignored\
   The importer won't fail when 5xx errors are returned by the server.
   These errors are normally due to invalid identities stored in the
   platform.
 * Increased minimum version for Python to 3.10\
   Python 3.9 reaches the end of life in October 2025. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   GrimoireLab supports Python 3.10 and higher from now on.
