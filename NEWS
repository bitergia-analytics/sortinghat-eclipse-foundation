**Bug fixes:**

 * Account fetching ordered by UID\
   Sort accounts by UID and adds support for resuming from a specific
   page.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Parallel processing for importing accounts\

   imports. By processing multiple accounts simultaneously, we reduce the
   overall time taken to fetch and process account data.

**Bug fixes:**

   Pagination wasn't done right. The backend did not use the right
   parameters to check when it have reached the last page of accounts.

  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

## sortinghat-eclipse-foundation 0.1.0 - (2025-09-24)

**New features:**

 * 5xx errors ignored\
   The importer won't fail when 5xx errors are returned by the server.
   These errors are normally due to invalid identities stored in the
   platform.
 * OAuth2 token refreshing\
   OAuth2 token will be refreshed when they expired.
 * 5xx errors handled for every request\
   Errors were only handled when profiles were fetched and not in other
   cases.
 * Increased minimum version for Python to 3.10\
   Python 3.9 reaches the end of life in October 2025. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   GrimoireLab supports Python 3.10 and higher from now on.
 * Eclipse Foundation identities importer\
   Implementation of a SortingHat backend to import identities from the
   Eclipse Foundation.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Handle of OAuth expired token\
   There was a bug making that the expiration time for a token was set to
   null. The token was not correctly initialized preventing the refresh
   of that token.
 * Minimum value for 'from_date' error\
   EclipseFoundation API only allows to fetch identities updated since
   the last year. The backend allowed dates before that but the server
   raised BadRequest error.
